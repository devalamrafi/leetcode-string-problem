## Notes / Learnings

- 04.01.2026
- Always visualise the sliding window for substring problems.  
- For hashset problems, remember to update your window to maintain **contiguous** property.
- Using Set instead of includes property reduces time complexity from O(n2) to O(n)

## Motivation
- Daily practice > Random practice. Consistency is key!
